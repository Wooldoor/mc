.TH MUSE 1
.SH NAME
muse
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B muse
.I -o out -p pkg [-h] [-d dbg] [-l libs]
.I [file...]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The muse tool acts as a linker for
.I .use
files. It reads all of the usefiles provided to it on the
command line, filters them by package, and outputs a new
usefile with the merged set of symbols. Both the
.I -o out.use
and the
.I -p pkg
options are mandatory.

.PP
The output of muse is architecture-independent. However, the format of the
generated file is not stable, and is not guaranteed to work across
different compiler versions.

.PP
The muse options are:

.TP
.B -d [flTri]
Print debugging dumps. Additional options may be given to give more
debugging information for specific intermediate states of the compilation.

.TP
.B -h
Print a summary of the available options.

.TP
.B -p package
Take the symbols that match
.I package
and their dependencies, and merge them into a single package. Only symbols
matching the package name will be reexported.

.TP
.B -o output-file
Specify that the generated usefile should be named 
.I output-file.
By convention,
.I output-file
should match up with the package name given to the
.I -p
option.

.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
